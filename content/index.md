# Hi there! 👋 
### I research recommender systems and user behavior at Harvard University

I am currently the [**Michael von Clemm Fellow**](https://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/news/alumnus-receives-michael-von-clemm-fellowship/) at Harvard, where I spend my time coding and thinking about how code is used. Right now, I am trying to understand the role of recommender systems in identity formation and manipulation.

I am also a research assistant at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society’s [**Institute for Rebooting Social Media**](https://rebootingsocialmedia.org/), where Professor David S. Craig and I are considering the political power of the creator economy.

I hold a BA in Music from Oxford University with the **[Gibbs Prize](https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/fees-funding/prizes-and-awards/gibbs)** and an MPhil in Digital Humanities from Cambridge University.

I made this page to house my [**CV**](Asker_Kurt-Elli_CV.pdf). But that seemed a little dull. So now it’s a catch-all for projects I am working on (academic and personal).

## Past

>[!example] POV: You're Reading about Playlisting Practices, Algorithmic Control, and Supercultural Resistance
>Cambridge, MPhil Dissertation, 2022-2023
>>[!question]- Recommender systems claim to provide personalized content and advertisements. What happens when we pretend to be someone else?
>>
>>I explore how point-of-view (POV) playlists on YouTube destabilize assumptions about the individual latent within recommender systems. I observe discontinuities between the idealized, algorithmically predictable listener and their appropriation of multiple POVs. Drawing on (post-)subcultural studies and Deleuzian philosophy, I interpret these POVs as “supercultural experiences”: distinctive, but generic, positions from a collective imagination that, when performed, afford access to experiences beyond one’s mundane cultural position. In dislocating playlisting practices from the listener’s identity, I argue that POV playlists offer a blueprint for resistance against algorithmic surveillance and control.

>[!example] Listening to Listening: Youtube Music Reaction Videos, Affective Tints, and Yebba’s Audience-Inferred Blackness
>Oxford, BA Dissertation, 2021-2022
>>[!question]- How do YouTube “reaction videos” change how we perceive media?
>>
>>To answer this, I investigate the culture of reactivity surrounding the white American singer-songwriter, Yebba. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis of reaction videos and their comments, I propose that reactor’s responses cast an “affective tint” over Yebba’s performances which amplify racialized discourse on not just reaction videos, but the original performances, too. In turn, this reiterates the multi-sourced and ephemeral construction of ostensibly immutable identities like race.
